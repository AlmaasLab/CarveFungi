# CarveFungi

CarveFungi is a genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction pipeline able to create a compartmentalized metabolic model of any fungal specie from its protein sequences. CarveFungi uses a deep learning model to predict the cellular localization of the proteins and this information is used to score the reactions.

CarveMe (https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky537) uses the scoring of the reactions to obtain a functional metabolic model that is able to produce biomass.
